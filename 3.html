<table><tr><td><h3><font color="yellow">Country music (or country and western) is a blend of traditional and popular US musical forms traditionally found in the Southern United States and the Canadian Maritimes that evolved rapidly beginning in the 1920s.[1] Distinctive variations of the genre have also emerged elsewhere including Australian country music.

The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s when the earlier term hillbilly music came to be seen as denigrating. Country music was widely embraced in the 1970s, while Country and Western has declined in use since that time, except in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it is still commonly used.[1] However, in the Southwestern United States a different mix of ethnic groups created the music that became the Western music of the term Country and Western. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres.</font></h3></td><td><img src="p3.jpg"></td></tr>
