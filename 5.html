<table><tr><td><h3><font color="yellow">Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s;[3]:251 generally characterized by a tempo of between 125 and 150 bpm,[3]:252 repeating melodic synthesizer phrases, and a musical form that builds up and breaks down throughout a track. It is a combination of many forms of music such as techno,[1]:15,17 house, industrial, new age, pop[1]:16, chill-out,[1]:17 ambient, electronic art music, classical music,[1]:16[2]:35 and film music.[2]:35 It is usually more melodic than techno, and the harder styles usually have harder beats than house. The origin of the term is uncertain, with some suggesting that the term is derived from the Klaus Schulze album Trancefer (1981) or the early trance act Dance 2 Trance. Others, though, argue the name may refer to an induced emotional feeling, high, euphoria, chills, or uplifting rush listeners claim to experience. Yet others trace the name to the actual trance-like states that the earliest forms of the music attempted to generate in the 1990s before the genre's focus changed.[3]:252

Trance also employs dynamics to a greater extent than most other forms of electronic music. A characteristic of many trance songs is the mid-song break in which the rhythm tracks are faded out, leaving the melody and/or atmospherics to stand alone for a few moments. The break adds some dynamics to the song, makes it more interesting to the ear, and provides dancers with a few moments in which they can improvise if they wish. Fashion tends to go back and forth between vocal and instrumental pieces every few years; usually when vocals are present, they are sung by a female singer with a soaring, operatic type voice.</font></h3></td><td><img src="p5.jpg"></td></tr>
